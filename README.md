# Web Modpack
### Lightweight and modern modpack for World of Tanks
<img src="https://shields.io/badge/version-0.0.3-blue">

The problem of all modpacks is their greater weight and the need to re-download the modpack when a new version of WoT is released.<br>
This modpack downloads only those mods that the user selected at runtime.<br>
Also it has a modern Web interface.<br>
Supports all client versions (including CT and SB)<br>
